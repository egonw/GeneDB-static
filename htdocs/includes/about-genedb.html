      <p class="card-text">The primary goal of GeneDB is to provide access to genome annotation for species that are undergoing manual curation and refinement.</p>
      <p class="card-text">The site is updated monthly to reflect close to real-time changes in annotation, before they have been propagated across EuPathDB and other sites with whom we collaborate. </p>
      <p class="card-text">Annotations reflect changes made in-house by scientists, as part of their research projects, and by dedicated curators based in-house and in collaborating organisations.</p>
